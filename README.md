### Global Adaptive Transformer for Cross-Subject EEG Classification [[Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9991178)]
##### Core idea: cross attention for distribution alignment

## Abstract
![Network Architecture](/Fig1.png)

- We propose a Global Adaptive Transformer, named GAT, for domain adaptation in EEG classification, where cross attention is used to align marginal distributions of source and target domains (subjects).
- Parallel convolution is used to capture temporal and spatial features while preserving the structure information of EEG signals.
- We design an adaptive center loss to align the conditional distribution of EEG features.
